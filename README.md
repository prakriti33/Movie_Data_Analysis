# Movie Data Analysis

This project explores a dataset of movies to extract insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover trends in movie releases, ratings, genres, and more.

##  Files Included

- 
- final_dataset.csv : Cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis.
- movie_analysis.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook containing step-by-step data analysis and visualizations.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Steps in the Project

 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed missing/null values.
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format.
- Handled duplicates and irrelevant rows.

 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted year and decade from `release_date`.
- Added new columns like `release_year` and `Decade`.

 3. **Data Visualization**
- Visualized movie counts by decade.
- Additional visualizations can be added (e.g., by genre, ratings, popularity).

 4. **Basic Analysis**
- Count of movies per decade.
- Basic trends in the movie industry over time.

# Sample Output

Bar chart showing the number of movies released per decade (e.g., 1950s, 2000s, etc.)

# Future Improvements

- Genre-wise trend analysis
- Ratings distribution
- Correlation between budget and popularity
- Dashboard in Power BI or Tableau

# Learnings

- Working with real-world messy datasets
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Using datetime in analysis
